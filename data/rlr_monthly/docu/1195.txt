There appears to be a spike in the dataset for November 2002. This is possibly real as a spike appears in Nov/Dec 2002 in several of the S. African stations.

The apparent spike in the monthly value for May 2014 was queried with the data suppliers. It was confirmed that the value was correct and was probably due to meteorological effects as the weather was described as 'shocking' with very strong onshore winds.

The apparent rise in sea level from June 2015 has been queried with the South African Navy. They have replied that there is quite a bit of seaweed growth in the area which may be contributing and intend to arrange for divers to cut this back. However, the data levels compare well with the predictions.

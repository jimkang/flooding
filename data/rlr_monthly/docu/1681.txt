Antalya II is on the Eastern Mediterranean coast. The station forms part of the
Turkish Sea Level Monitoring network.Coast/Station code 310/052 id=1681.Total
dataset has been updated
by the authority. A new RLR diagram was created. RLR (2007) is 8.000m below
TGBM ANTL-1. RLR factor is 4.836m.

Scientists from a number of German Environmental and Geoscience Institutes have published a paper in the Journal of Geophysical Research (JGR-Oceans) describing the analysis of data from Antalya, Eastern Mediterranean. MSL data from Antalya (id.400) has been merged with Antalya II (id.1681).In the analysis ‘Metric’ data from Antalya I has been aligned with the RLR dataset from Antalya II. The paper includes the full history of the station and the data itself. View the paper at the link:-

Following a recent download of data for King Bay from the NTC website it was noticed that the data for 2008 had been revised. This data has now been re-loaded onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 16-Mar-2020
A comparison of data with that currently available from the Bureau of Meteorology shows the switch in datum to LAT occurred at the start of 2008, not 2009 (hence the correction of 2008 data made in 2013).

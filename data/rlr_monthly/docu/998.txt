New data from John Hannah added 17/01/03 which supercedes old data.
New data does not have any missing days information.
Old data has been backed up.

New data from John Hannah was for Auckland II, Dunedin II,
Lyttelton II and Wellington II.

There is a new John Hannah paper referring to New Zealand data for
Wellington, Dunedin, Lyttelton and Auckland. The reference is:
"An updated analysis of long-term sea level change in New Zealand."

Revised data received from Glen Rowe at LINZ
data span 1987-2007. Previous data for 1994 from 
database copied data replaced with revised dataset.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 18-Oct-2010
Following correspondence with Glen Rowe it was confirmed that the datum at
Timaru has been as follows:
Pre 1976 TGZ =5.301m below benchmark UD 44
Post 1976 TGZ =5.286m below UD 44
Previous benchmark UD 42 is 0.466m above UD 44

The Kaikoura earthquake of 23:02 on the 13 November 2016 impacted on a number of stations in the central part of New Zealand. Because of this the hourly height values for several stations from 14th November 00:00hrs have been adjusted by LINZ. For station Timaru the adjust is -0.008m.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 25-Aug-2020
The adjustment due to the Kaik≈çura earthquake of 2016 has been removed as relative sea level series should include land movement.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Oct-2020
Benchmark UD44 has been destroyed, so UD42 is now the primary benchmark again
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 23-Aug-2021
A revised copy of the New Zealand data values for Timaru Harbour has been received from the data supplier the Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). The revised data begins from 2014. This exercise has been carried out to correct some anomalies with the high frequency data.
Adjustment has also been applied to the data to account for the Kaikoura earthquake by creating a new datum TGZ December 2016 5.744m below benchmark UD42.
Consequently the Metric data has had the effect of Kaikoura removed but the effect of the earthquake is still evident in the RLR data.

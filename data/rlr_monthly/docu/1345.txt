Following review of data affected by the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011, all data has been flagged as good as GSI have recommenced levelling at the site. The station flag has been set to indicate the record needs to be treated with care, but the data appears to accurately reflect the earthquake's ongoing effect on local relative sea level.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 26-Apr-2022
Documentation from the GSI confirms this installation was destroyed in the tsunami following the Tōhoku earthquake in March 2011. A temporary gauge was set up in June 2011, and a new permanent installation began operating in September 2015. Data from the temporary site have not been connected to the primary benchmark through levelling, so this period is not included in the RLR dataset.

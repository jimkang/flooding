The Norwegian Mapping Authority has revised their datasets. The Primary benchmark for Tromso is now O6 N21 11.249m above TGZ. RLR for the dataset was re-calculated using 2008 as the RLR year. The revised RLR factor is now 5.551m while RLR (2008) is 16.8m below TGBM O6 N21.

Between July 1961 and May 1986 the stations was situated north of the Troms√∏ bridge in Hansfjordnesbukta. The tidal amplitude north of the bridge is about 7% higher than south of the bridge, where the tide gauge has been located for the rest of the record, although in several different locations. It is not known whether these higher tidal amplitudes will influence monthly or annual means.

- Vary attack amplitudes.
- Bass is hitting negative playback rates around tick 79. Maybe there should be negative values at the end.
- Narration sample plays only partially around 1100. And at the 1990 one.
- Narration is too loud.
- Freaks out around 1166.
- Fade out main after last tick.

Done:

  - Use scale to map to a tick length.
    - There's a difference between tick length and duration. More events need to overlap.
- Need ending.
- Narration sample plays only partially around 1961.
- Add a high vibraphone part?
- Add a high flute part?
- Pops at ticks:
  - 31
  - 49
  - 72
  - 96
  - 100
  - 102
  - 339
- High part too piercing. Down an octave?
- Things feel stuck around tick 800. A lot of the bigger chords (~20 pitches) are going by really quickly, so everything seems a little samey. Maybe don't make the big chords quite as short?
  - More intensity is needed at the end.

These aren't really an issue, it turns out:
- Horn loop seems rough at the beginning. More gradual ramp?
- Too quiet? May need light compression.
- Vary loop lengths.
- More pops around 145, possibly in bass. Also 55, 270, 520, 720

 Is the compressor actually doing anything? A: Nothing important.

- Supplemental page that lets you hear what the different chords sound like.
- Visualize heat as speed
- Cut reverb mix as time goes on?
- Joule reference scale
- Pause button

Done:

- Pauses between decades. (Used small pause; long pauses lose momentum.)
- More end intensity might be nice. Maybe fade the pipe organ a bit there?
- More trumpet thickness somehow.
- Low pipe organ sample?
- Some synth cheesiness around 170. Could use more mids?
- Stop distortion and browser crash.
- Avoid crash by stopping notes instead of using fadeToDeath when things get fast. Around tick 193.
  - It crashes the browser around 200, but it does not hit the "curve down in progress" error if you change the loop length from 4 to 1 in the main part. I think this dodges that particular issue.
- Slow down marimba.
- Try French horn again.
- Marimba loop: 1s?
- Maybe pan the parts more left and right.
- Glass more-full with spacey-impulse!
- Arbitrary transpose parts, not just low and high.
- Piano sample?
- Turn down marimba or reduce reverb mix
- Bring back long ending.
- Try higher trumpet again

Old:

- Other data sets
  - They all need to be transformed so that the end up as rows of { date, year, month, value }
  - Support changing the set in the url.
  - Different defaults for different sets.

- Vary attack amplitudes.
- Bass is hitting negative playback rates around tick 79. Maybe there should be negative values at the end.

Done:

  - Use scale to map to a tick length.
    - There's a difference between tick length and duration. More events need to overlap.
- Need ending.
- Narration sample plays only partially around 1961.
- Add a high vibraphone part?
- Add a high flute part?
- Pops at ticks:
  - 31
  - 49
  - 72
  - 96
  - 100
  - 102
  - 339
- High part too piercing. Down an octave?
- Things feel stuck around tick 800. A lot of the bigger chords (~20 pitches) are going by really quickly, so everything seems a little samey. Maybe don't make the big chords quite as short?
  - More intensity is needed at the end.
- Narration sample plays only partially around 1100. And at the 1990 one.
- Fade out main after last tick.

These aren't really an issue, it turns out:

- Horn loop seems rough at the beginning. More gradual ramp?
- Too quiet? May need light compression.
- Vary loop lengths.
- More pops around 145, possibly in bass. Also 55, 270, 520, 720
- Narration is too loud.

Can't repro:

- Freaks out around 1166.

 Is the compressor actually doing anything? A: Nothing important.

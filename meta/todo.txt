Pops at ticks:

- 31
- 49
- 72
- 96
- 100
- 102
- 339

- Need ending.
- Things feel stuck around tick 800. A lot of the bigger chords (~20 pitches) are going by really quickly, so everything seems a little samey. Maybe don't make the big chords quite as short?
- Vary attack amplitudes.
- More intensity is needed at the end.
- Bass is hitting negative playback rates around tick 79. Maybe there should be negative values at the end.

Done:

- Narration sample plays only partially around 1961.
- Add a high vibraphone part?
- Add a high flute part?
- Is the compressor actually doing anything? A: Nothing important.
